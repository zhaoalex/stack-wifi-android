        This is an application for The Stack that will collect data about your location and connected wifi networks.
        Please ensure that you enable the location permission for the app, and keep GPS on so that we can ensure proper data collection.
        The app will not track your location if you are outside the UCLA campus, and your identity is not tied to any information we collect.
        Feel free to slack #the-stack if you have any questions. Thank you for participating in this data collection experiment!

    <string name="android_string">
        \n\nFor Android users:\n
        • You can keep using your phone normally! We collect data in the background and minimize battery usage.\n\n
        • If you want to stop at any time, just kill this app (or press the stop button in the notification).\n\n
        • If you want to see the actual data collection, press \"Show Data\" on the bottom (and \"Hide Data\" to come back to this screen)!
